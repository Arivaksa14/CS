# Problem Statement:Write and test a function to meet this specification.
#sumList(nums) nums is a list of numbers.
#Returns the sum of the numbers in the list.
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. Create a sumList function that calculates the sum of numbers in the main()
# 2. Create a numer list in the main function
# 3. Invoke sumList function 
# 4. Print the sum of the numbers in the list to the screen
#
# import the necessary python libraries
# for this example none are needed
import math

def sumList(nums):
    total=0
    for x in nums:
        total += x
    return total

def main():
    nums=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100]
    print("sum = ",sumList(nums))


main()
