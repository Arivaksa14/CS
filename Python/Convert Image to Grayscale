# Problem Statement: Write a program that converts a color image to grayscale.
#The user supplies the name of a file containing a GIF or PPM image, and the program loads the image and displays the file.
#At the click of the mouse, the program converts the image to grayscale.
#The user is then prompted for a filename to store the grayscale image in. 
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. Display welcome message and promt user for file input and output
# 2. Get width and height using image file to get dynamics of window.
# 3. Get center point of photo and current pixel for the loop
# 3. Create a for loop for width and height. Update each time
# 4. Click for exit 
# 5. Display the output to the screen and save it in the user-indicated file.
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries: graphics
from graphics import*
