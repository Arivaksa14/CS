# Problem Statement: Write a program that prompts the user for a 4-digit year and then outputs the value of the epact. 
#
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. Print an initial welcoming message to the screen
# 2. Prompt the user for a 4-digit year input
# 3. Calculate the C using given formula
# 4. Calculate the epact value using given formula
# 5. Print the epact value to the screen
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries
# for this example math library is needed

def main():
   print("The Gregorian epact is the number of days between January 1st and the previous new moon.  This value is used to figure out the date of Easter.")
   print ()
   year = eval(input("Please enter a 4-digit year: "))
   C = year // 100
   epact = (8+(C//4) - C + ((8*C + 13)//25) + 11*(year%19))%30

   print("The epact value is ", epact)
