# Problem Statement: Create a program that counts the reserved words in a python file.
#Use the reserved word list found in Appendix A of your textbook.  
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. Create a dictionary with reserved words
# 2. prompt for a source code file name
# 3. Count reserved words in the provided file
# 4. Display the keywords and their frequency
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries: none

def main():
    print("This program counts the reserved words in a python file")
  

    keywords={"False","None","True","and","as","assert","break","class","continue",
              "def","del", "elif","else","except","finally","for","from","global",
              "if","import","in","is","lambda","nonlocal","not","or","pass","raise",
              "return","try","while","yield"}

    # get the sequence of words from the file
    filename=input("Enter a Pyhton source code filename: ").strip()

    infile=open(filename,"r")
    text=infile.read().split()

    
    #construct a dictionary of word counts
    counts = {}
    for w in text:
        if w in keywords:
            counts[w] = counts.get(w,0) + 1
        #if w is not alredy in the disctionary, this
        #get will return 0, and the result is that the entry for w is set to 1.
            
    for i in keywords:
        count = counts.get(i,0)
        print("{0:<15}{1:>5}".format(i, count))
