# Problem Statement: Write definitions for these functions:
#sphereArea(radius) Returns the surface area of a sphere having the given radius.
#sphereVolume(radius) Returns the volume of a sphere having the given radius. 
#
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. Promt the user for radius input
# 2. create two different functions for area and volume of the sphere
# 3. Invoke both area and volume fuctions in the main
# 4. Print the area volume to the screen given the user's radius
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries
# for this example math is needed
import math

def sphereArea(radius):
    area=4*(radius**2)*math.pi
    return area;
def sphereVolume(radius):
    volume=(4/3)*math.pi*(radius**3)
    return volume;

def main():
    radius=eval(input("Please enter the radius:" ))
    area=sphereArea(radius)
    volume=sphereVolume(radius)
    
    print("Area of the sphere is ",round(area,3))
    print("Volume of the sphere is ",round(volume,3))
    
main()
