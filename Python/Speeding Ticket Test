# Problem Statement: The speeding ticket fin policy in Poducksville is $50 plus $5 for each mph over the limit plus a penalty of $200 for any speed over 90 mph.
#Write a program that accepts a speed limit and a clocked speed and either prints a message indicating the speed was legal or prints the amount of the fine, if the speed is illegal. (#6, pg. 230)
# Overall Plan:
# 1. Print an initial welcoming message to the screen
# 2. Prompt the user for speed limit and clocked speed inputs
# 3. Calculate the estimated fine if clocked speed exceeded the speed limit. 
# 4. Print the fine amount to the screen
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries
# for this example none are needed


def main():
    # Print a message to the screen
    print("Hello!")
    print("The speeding ticket fin policy in Poducksville is $50 plus $5 for each mph over the limit plus a penalty of $200 for any speed over 90 mph.")

    # Variables are declared dynamically no need to pre-define
    speed_limit = eval(input("Enter the speed limit:"))
    clocked_speed = eval(input("Enter the clocked speed:"))
    
    #Here is the processing that is needed
    if clocked_speed<=speed_limit:
        print("The speed was legal! Drive safe!")
    elif clocked_speed>speed_limit:
        difference=clocked_speed-speed_limit
        if clocked_speed-speed_limit>90:
            fine=50+5*difference+200
            print("Your fine according to fin policy in Poducksville is $",fine)
        else:
            fine=50+5*difference
            print("Your fine according to fin policy in Poducksville is $",fine)
        
            
    else:
        print ("Please enter the speed limit and clocked speed in mph.")
