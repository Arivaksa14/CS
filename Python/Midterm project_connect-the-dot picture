# Problem Statement: You need to create a program that allows you to create a connect-the-dot picture.  
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. Get a point input from the user
# 2. Get up to 100 new point inputs from the user, connect two neighboring dots by drawing a line segment
# 3. Display each point to the screen, connect dots to make a picture.
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries
# for this example graphics library is needed

from graphics import*

def main():
    win=GraphWin("Draw a line segment",600,600)
    win.setBackground("white")
    win.setCoords(0.0,0.0,10.0,10.0)
    message=Text(Point(14,-15),"Click on up to 100 points to draw your picture").draw(win)

    p1=win.getMouse().draw(win)
    message1=Text(Point(p1.getX(),p1.getY()),"p1").draw(win)
 
    for i in range(1,100):
        p2=win.getMouse().draw(win)
        message2=Text(Point(p2.getX(),p2.getY()),"p"+str(i+1)).draw(win)
        line=Line(p1,p2)
        line.setOutline("black")
        line.draw(win)
        p1=p2
main()
