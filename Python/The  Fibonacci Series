# Problem Statement: Write a program that computes and outputs the nth Fibonacci number,
#where n is a value entered by the user.
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. Prompt user for nth number in the Fibonacci series
# 2. Read in the number input from the user
# 3. Create a function called fibonacci that takes in thr user input
# 4. The fucntion will return a number after computing a formula: each number is a sum of previous two
# 5. Display the output to the screen.
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries: none


def main():
     print(fibonacci(num));
    

def fibonacci(num):
 num1 = 1
 num2 = 1
 series = 0
 for i in range(num):
     num1 = num2;
     num2 = series;
     series = num1 + num2;
 return series

num = int(input('Which nth number in the Fibonacci series would you like to see?: '))

main()
