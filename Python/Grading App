# Problem Statement: Write a program that calculates and prints your grade.
#Input is the percentage of points that you received, the output is the letter grade.
#Use the grading scale for this class. Copied from the syllabus: 
#90% -100%           A
#80% - 89.99%        B
#70% - 79.99%        C
#60% - 69.99%        D
#0%   - 59.99%       F
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. Print an initial welcoming message to the screen
# 2. Prompt the user for percentage grade input
# 3. Calculate the grade lette using class grading
# 4. Print the letter grade to the screen
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries
# for this example none are needed


def main():
    # Print a message to the screen
    print("Hello!")
    print("Let's calculate your letter grade for this class!")

    # Variables are declared dynamically no need to pre-define
    grade = eval(input("Enter the percentage points you received in the class:"))
  
    #Here is the processing that is needed
    if grade>=90 and grade <=100:
        letter_grade="A"
    elif grade>=80 and grade<90:
        letter_grade="B"
    elif grade>=70 and grade<80:
        letter_grade="C"
    elif grade>=60 and grade<70:
        letter_grade="D"
    elif grade<60 and grade>=0:
        letter_grade="F"
    else:
       letter_grade= print("Please enter a grade that is within the grading scale")
       quit()
    
    # Output the results
    print("The letter grade you got is", letter_grade)

main()
