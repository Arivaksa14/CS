# Problem Statement: Write a program to print the lyrics for ten verses of "The Ants Go Marching."
#A couple of sample verses are given in the book.  
#Make sure you make a function for the code.  This function should be called ten times.
#This method should have two parameters, one for the number of ants and another for the action of the ant(s).
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. Create ants funtion with two parameters that change throughout the song
# 2.Create a refrain function with no parameters that remains the same throughout the song
# 3. Invoke both ants and refrain fuctions in the main when needed
# 4. Print all ten verses to the screen
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries
# for this example none are needed
