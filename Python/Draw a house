# Problem Statement: You are to write a program that allows the user to draw a simple house using five mouse-clicks. 
#The first two clicks will be the opposite corners of the rectangular frame of the house.
#The third click will indicate the center of the top edge of a rectangulr door.
#The door should have a total width this is 1/5 of the width of the house frame.  
#The sides door should extend from the corners of the top down to the bottom of the frame. 
# The fourth click will indicate the center of a square window.  The windows is half as wide as the door.
# The last click will indicate the peak of the roof.  
#The edges of the roof will extend from the point at the peak to the corners of the top edge of the house frame.
#
# Overall Plan:

#1.import graphics, set coordinates and color of the graphics window.
#2.set points 1 and 2 as user input
#3.create frame, house, door,window, and roof outlines with different colors.
#4.display the 5 point house outline on the screen
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries
# for this example graphics.py is needed
