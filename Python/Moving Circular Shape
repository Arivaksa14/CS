# Problem Statement: Write a function to meet this specification.
#moveTo(shape, newCenter) shape is a graphics object that supports the getCenter method and newCenter is a Point.
#Moves shape so that newCenter is its center.
#
#Use your function to write a program that draws a circle and then allows the user to click the window 10 times.
#Each time the user clicks, the circle is moved where the user clicked.
#
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. Promt the user for radius input
# 2. create two different functions for area and volume of the sphere
# 3. Invoke both area and volume fuctions in the main
# 4. Print the area volume to the screen given the user's radius
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries
# for this example graphics is needed
