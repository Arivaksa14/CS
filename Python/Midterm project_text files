# Problem Statement: Write a program that finds the mean, median, and standard deviation(these should be functions)of a list of numbers which you read from a file.
#1 number per line and should support both positive and negative number. 
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. Read in the input text file
# 2. Calculate mean, median,SD, and 2 SD range by using functions for each calculation.
# 3. Create common error messages 
# 4. Display the mean, median, and standard deviation range to the screen.
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries
# for this example math library is needed
import math
